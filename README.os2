Note that the Joliet implementation on OS/2 is buggy:

It expects the file in the directories in the wrong order.
While Microsoft wants the files to be in ASCII (binary) order,
OS/2 likes to have the files in lexical order (uppercase and
lowercase together). This makes CD's with Joliet attributes
unreadable on OS/2 if there are files that start the same way
but differ in case.
