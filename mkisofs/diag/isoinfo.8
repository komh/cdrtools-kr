.SH DESCRIPTION
.B devdump
is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of device or
filesystem images.
The initial screen is a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte
sector.
The commands are the same as with 
.BR isodump .
.PP
.B isodump
is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of iso9660 images
in order to verify directory integrity.
The initial screen is a display of the first part of the root directory,
and the prompt shows you the extent number and offset in the extent.
.RS
.PP
You can use the 'a' and 'b'
commands to move backwards and forwards within the image. The 'g' command
allows you to goto an arbitrary extent, and the 'f' command specifies
a search string to be used. The '+' command searches forward for the next
instance of the search string, and the 'q' command exits
.B devdump
or
.BR isodump .
.RE
.PP
.B isoinfo
is a utility to perform directory like listings of iso9660 images.
.PP
.B isovfy
is a utility to verify the integrity of an iso9660 image. Most of the tests
in
.B isovfy
were added after bugs were discovered in early versions of
.B mkisofs.
It isn't all that clear how useful this is anymore, but it doesn't hurt to
have this around.

.SH OPTIONS
Only the
.B isoinfo
program has any command line options. These are:
.TP
.B \-h
print a summary of all options.
.TP
.B \-d
Print information from the primary volume descriptor (PVD) of the iso9660
image. This includes information about Rock Ridge and Joliet extensions
if present.
.TP
.B \-f
generate output as if a 'find . -print' command had been run on the iso9660
image. You should not use the
.B -l
image with the
.B -f
option.
.TP
.B \-i iso_image
Specifies the path of the iso9660 image that we wish to examine.
.TP
.B \-l
generate output as if a 'ls -lR' command had been run on the iso9660 image.
You should not use the
.B -f
image with the
.B -l
option.
.TP
.B \-N sector
Quick hack to help examine single session disc files that are to be written to
a multi-session disc. The sector number specified is the sector number at
which the iso9660 image should be written when send to the cd-writer. Not
used for the first session on the disc.
.TP
.B \-p
Print path table information.
.TP
.B \-R
Extract information from Rock Ridge extensions (if present) for permissions,
file names and ownerships.
.TP
.B \-J
Extract information from Joliet extensions (if present) for file names.
.TP
.B \-j charset
Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the supplied charset. See
.BR mkisofs (8)
for details.
.TP
.B \-T sector
Quick hack to help examine multi-session images that have already been burned
to a multi-session disc. The sector number specified is the sector number for
the start of the session we wish to display.
.TP
.B \-x pathname
Extract specified file to stdout.
.SH AUTHOR
Eric Youngdale <ericy@gnu.ai.mit.edu> or <eric@andante.jic.com> is to blame
for these shoddy hacks. Patches to improve general usability would be
gladly accepted.
.SH BUGS
The user interface really sucks.
.SH FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
These utilities are really quick hacks, which are very useful for debugging
problems in mkisofs or in an iso9660 filesystem. In the long run, it would
be nice to have a daemon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.
.PP
The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of the most use to
the general user.
.SH AVAILABILITY
These utilities come with the mkisofs package, and the primary ftp site
is tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/BETA/cdrom/mkisofs and many other mirror
sites. Despite the name, the software is not beta.
